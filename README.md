## Known Issues

- This is an experimental project, expect rough edges and potential bugs
- Application is currently unsigned (requires manual security bypass)
- Only tested on macOS Sonoma
- Limited error handling in some edge cases
- No automatic updates
- Not recommended for critical production environments without thorough testing
- May have unexpected behavior with certain SSH configurations
